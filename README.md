# Book library

This project allows you to look for any book in two languages - english and polish. 
It returns data from google api - https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes.

As a user, you can select which book is already in your library. This functionality works only within opened window, after reload it starts from the beginning.

The live application is available here: https://book-library-tan.vercel.app/

The project showcases my React skills, that is why the design of the app is basic.
